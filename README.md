DroppableView.js
================

In the current version of Famo.us, "interactions such as drag and drop are harder to implement, but this is intended and we are working on an elegant solution for these use-cases." The reason is there are no absolute positions available through Surfaces. This is an implementation of a DroppableView done in 24 hours. It's meant as an exercise and shouldn't be used for production code.
